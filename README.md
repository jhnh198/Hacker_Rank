# Hacker_Rank
Repo for Hacker rank group members to post submissions to problems. You can get help with your code and help others with theirs. Access code methods / tools for future use and to show others. 

DISCLAIMER :

  Do not plagarize. If you wish to use a method or program in your own code, feel free, but give the author credit. Make sure you understand what you are using if you use it. Otherwise, you will miss out on the opportunity to learn. 
  
  Plagarism will not hurt us here, but it will hurt you because you won't have an idea how it works. You should not use code you don't fully understand since if the code is poor and you don't see how bad or broken it is, the code could give you some serious problems, and can cost you or the company money, and get you in trouble. 
  
  (Side note)For this reason, encapsulation is a wonderful thing.
  
  I do not wish to scare you with the evils of the world, I just want give you some persepctive.

read this before submitting code.
1: When uploading code, put your name in the title and in first a first line comment.
2: Put the date after your name
3: Provide a brief explanation of what your code does, or attempts to do
4: Place known bug notes, including features that don't work or are not implemented.
5: Finally, make sure that your code is as complete as possible before commiting to the group repo. Work in your local repo until the code is ready. 
6: If you want help, try to only ask for one item that needs to be improved. If multiple issues occur from the one, try to rework your implementation and make the issues less/not dependant (coupled) to each other. If there are still more problems, then it is okay to ask for a solution to these issues.

It will be far easier for others to understand and help you if you follow these rules. Breaking these rules will make it less likely that someone will want / be able to help you.

That being said, please feel free to use the heck out of this repo. It will only help you become a better programmer and team worker. Provide suggestions to improve others code. Provide your own code to the help others and to get help on issues.
